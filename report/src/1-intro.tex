\section{Introduction}
Cardiovascular disease continues to be a critical global health issue, representing a substantial share of death and morbidity globally. Timely identification and treatment are essential in alleviating the impact of cardiac disease, enabling prompt therapies that enhance patient outcomes. The diagnosis of cardiac disease conventionally depends on clinical competence, laboratory analyses, and imaging examinations. Nonetheless, these methods may be laborious, resource-demanding, and susceptible to human mistake. With the increasing amount and complexity of healthcare data, machine learning (ML) presents a viable approach to improve diagnostic procedures by automating risk prediction and revealing patterns that may not be readily discernible to doctors.

Machine learning models are proficient in processing intricate datasets, making them suitable for addressing the complexities of heart disease detection. These models may analyze previous data to forecast future results, discern critical risk variables, and facilitate decision-making in healthcare environments. This research intends to use machine learning methodologies to develop a prediction model for heart disease risk, using the Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset. This dataset encompasses several patient features, including demographic data, clinical measures, and test results, making it suitable for machine learning research.

To successfully tackle the issue, we will examine and contrast three prominent machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Networks. These models are selected for their unique advantages and their prevalent use in classification tasks. Logistic Regression offers a straightforward and comprehensible framework for elucidating the associations between characteristics and the probability of heart disease. Random Forest provides strong performance and the capacity to identify intricate, nonlinear relationships among variables. Artificial Neural Networks, recognized for their proficiency in managing high-dimensional datasets, excel at identifying decision boundaries that delineate classes.

The primary objective of this study is to use machine learning models to forecast the occurrence of heart disease based on critical attributes in the dataset. Through the assessment and comparison of these models' performance, we want to determine the most effective algorithm while acquiring insights into the use of machine learning in healthcare data. This study advances the expanding domain of predictive analytics in healthcare, highlighting the capacity of data-driven methodologies to enhance patient care and results.
