% Dataset Description
\section{Dataset}
The Cleveland Heard Disease Dataset serves as our foundation for this study. It consists of 13 attributes and 303 samples. The target variable ($y$) indicates the presence or absence of heart disease, which provides a binary classification for our models. A list of the 13 attributes are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Age: The patientâ€™s age in years.
    \item Sex: A binary variable indicating gender (1 for male, 0 for female).
    \item Chest Pain Type: Categorized into four types, reflecting the nature of chest discomfort.
    \item Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps): Measured in mmHg at rest.
    \item Serum Cholesterol (chol): Measured in mg/dL.
    \item Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs): A binary variable indicating whether fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dL.
    \item Resting Electrocardiographic Results (restecg): Categorical data reflecting the outcome of the electrocardiogram at rest.
    \item Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (thalach): A continuous variable representing the maximum heart rate during stress.
    \item Exercise-Induced Angina (exang): A binary variable indicating the presence of angina during exercise.
    \item Old Peak (ST depression): Numerical value indicating ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
    \item Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment: Categorical data indicating the slope of the ST segment during peak exercise.
    \item Number of Major Vessels (ca): Numeric variable representing major vessels colored by fluoroscopy.
\end{itemize}
