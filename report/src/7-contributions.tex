\section{Contributions}

\subsection{Anirudh Basu}

Anirudh contributed to the final report by completing the exploratory data analysis (EDA), artificial neural network model, and creating the web app. In the EDA section, Anirudh analyzed the dataset, identifying the distribution of features, and the correlation between them. In the artificial neural network model section, Anirudh implemented the model, trained it, and evaluated its performance. In the web app section, Anirudh created a web app using Flask, which allows users to input patient data and get predictions on the likelihood of a cardiovascular disease diagnosis.

\subsection{Bipasha Sengupta}
Bipasha contributed to the final report by completing the introduction, literature review, and conclusion parts. In the introduction, Bipasha delineated the importance of predicting cardiovascular illness and the contribution of machine learning models in improving diagnostic methods. The literature study highlighted the use of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), accentuating their advantages and pertinence to our project. In the end, Bipasha consolidated the results, emphasizing the potential of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to tackle intricate, high-dimensional medical datasets, while proposing future avenues for improving interpretability and therapeutic relevance.

\subsection{William Popov Spektor}
William contributed to the final report by drafting the abstract and dataset sections, ensuring any reader could clearly understand each written section. William also edited the entire document, changing layouts, grammar and structure, as well as the overall flow of material. Additionally, William helped in selecting the three models, providing insights into the benefits and drawbacks of all discussed models, eventually helping the group come to the conclusion: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Networks.
