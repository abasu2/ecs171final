\section{Exploratory Data Analysis}

For each feature, we created and examined either a histogram (for numerical features) or a bar chart (for categorical features). For each feature, we also recorded descriptive statistics and noted whether there were any outliers, missing values, or rare categories. To determine the relationship between the features in the dataset, we performed a correlation analysis on the data. For each pair of numerical features, we created a scatter plot. We also created a correlation heatmap of the data (pictured above). Based on the correlation heatmap, we determined that no two features are especially correlated (other than ``oldpeak'' representing ST-segment depression on an ECG during exercise, and ``slope'' representing ST/HR slope). From these results, we tentatively did not perform any dimensionality reduction.
