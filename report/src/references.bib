  abstract       = {This paper reviews applications of machine learning (ML) predictive models in the diagnosis of chronic diseases. Chronic diseases (CDs) are responsible for a major portion of global health costs. Patients who suffer from these diseases need lifelong treatment. Nowadays, predictive models are frequently applied in the diagnosis and forecasting of these diseases. In this study, we reviewed the state-of-the-art approaches that encompass ML models in the primary diagnosis of CD. This analysis covers 453 papers published between 2015 and 2019, and our document search was conducted from PubMed (Medline), and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) libraries. Ultimately, 22 studies were selected to present all modeling methods in a precise way that explains CD diagnosis and usage models of individual pathologies with associated strengths and limitations. Our outcomes suggest that there are no standard methods to determine the best approach in real-time clinical practice since each method has its advantages and disadvantages. Among the methods considered, support vector machines (SVM), logistic regression (LR), clustering were the most commonly used. These models are highly applicable in classification, and diagnosis of CD and are expected to become more important in medical practice in the near future.},

  abstract = {Objective
              To evaluate the performance of machine learning (ML) algorithms and to compare them with logistic regression for the prediction of risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes (DM), and hypertension (HTN) and in a prospective cohort study using simple clinical predictors.
              Study Design and Setting
              We conducted analyses in a population-based cohort study in Asian adults (n = 6,762). Five different ML models were considered—single-hidden-layer neural network, support vector machine, random forest, gradient boosting machine, and k-nearest neighbor—and were compared with standard logistic regression.
              Results
              The incidences at 6 years of CVD, CKD, DM, and HTN cases were 4.0%, 7.0%, 9.2%, and 34.6%, respectively. Logistic regression reached the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for CKD (0.905 [0.88, 0.93]) and DM (0.768 [0.73, 0.81]) predictions. For CVD and HTN, the best models were neural network (0.753 [0.70, 0.81]) and support vector machine (0.780 [0.747, 0.812]), respectively. However, the differences with logistic regression were small (less than 1%) and nonsignificant. Logistic regression, gradient boosting machine, and neural network were systematically ranked among the best models.
              Conclusion
              Logistic regression yields as good performance as ML models to predict the risk of major chronic diseases with low incidence and simple clinical predictors.}

However, the existing framework of machine learning is limited by the limitations of machine learning algorithm itself, such as the choice of parameters and the interference of noises, the high using threshold and so on. This paper introduces the research background of machine learning framework, and combined with the commonly used random forest algorithm in machine learning classification algorithm, puts forward the research objectives and content, proposes an improved adaptive random forest algorithm (referred to as ARF), and on the basis of ARF, designs and implements the machine learning framework.},
